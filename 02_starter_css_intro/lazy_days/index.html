        <h2>Never Eat At Home Again</h2>
      	<h3>By Susan Smith</h3>
        <img src="images/diner.jpg" alt="diner">
        <p>	As my New Year's resolution in 2016, I vowed to never again make a meal at home.
          I found that cooking meals at home took time and effort, and the food never seemed to
          measure up to the greasy food that is readily available at any old diner.

          <h2>The Art of Doing Absolutely Nothing</h2>
        	<h3>By José Peréz</h3>

          <p>Is your job taking too much time away from your rest and relaxation? Does your alegebra homework keep you up at night? I used to be in the same boat until I quit work and school and devoted myself to doing absolutely nothing. Many people think that laziness is a vice, but I am here to tell you that it is an art.
